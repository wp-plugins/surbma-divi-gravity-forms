Responsive Divi form styles for Gravity Forms.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the same styling for Gravity Forms as Divi Theme has for its own forms. This is a very lightweight plugin with minified css to reduce the loading time as low as possible.

= Responsive style =

It also adds responsive styles to Gravity Forms. So you can use complex forms, halves or thirds fields, your form will look great on mobile screens also.

You have to buy the Divi Theme and the Gravity Forms Plugin to use this plugin:

- [Gravity Forms](http://surbma.com/go/gravityforms/) (affiliate link)
